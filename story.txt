Jane was at her very favorite cafe, the Bald Brew. Jane wanted to get a drink, and went up to order a hot coffee. Unfortunately, once she got up to the counter, she realized she forgot her wallet. Dejected, she began to walk away and then realized she had actually left her wallet in her car. Walking outside to grab it, she noticed that there was something odd in the sky.
It was cats flying in the sky. Jane saw all colors, shapes, and faces of cats. All in formation with the same beauty as ducks migrating to the south for warmer climates. As she looked around confused and scared as to what was happening. The news outlets in all channels were revealing what the military and Government had agreed this would be known as... The Big Cat Revellion.
